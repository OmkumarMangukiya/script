My Project : I am building a `AI Workflow Generator`saas it lets you create n8n workflow with just a natural language prompt . So user will give prompt and I will have a fine tuned model which will then create a workfow (in .json ) and give it to user and then the user will download that json file and upload it to n8n and hence the workflow will be loaded there and user can use it from there.

Issue : To fine tune gpt4o-mini I need data the jsonl file

What I have : A json file which contains {name , description , json workflow} of a workflow lets name it workflow_data.json 

Help :  I need a to train chatgpt4o-mini and for that I need to get prompts (prompts which user will give to my saas) and this prompts needs to be generated on the basis of the name and description of workflow (in workflow_data.json). For example in json if i have something like this {"name" : "Notion AI Assistant Generator" , "description" :"This n8n workflow template lets teams easily generate a custom AI chat assistant based on the schema of any Notion database. Simply provide the Notion database URL, and the workflow downloads the schema and creates a tailored AI assistant designed to interact with that specific database structure. Features : Instant Assistant Generation, Advanced Querying  ,Schema Awareness     , Reference Links , Self-Validation", "workflow":{//here will be workflow in json}} and the I need the user prompts on bases of name and description like this output : "Build a workflow for the Notion AI Assistant Generator that downloads a Notion database schema from a provided URL and creates a custom AI chat assistant with advanced querying, schema awareness, reference links, and self-validation features." the ouput prompts can be a little different but it should look natural like a human prompt and doesnt include much question like "how can i " , "what is the " and blah blah. After generating the prompt i need the final things in a jsonl file which needs to be structured properly so that it caould be directly use to train chatgpt4o-mini model. I want a python script which implements all this .
